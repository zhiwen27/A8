## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
