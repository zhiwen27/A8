# A8 Card Sorting

# Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

## General Information

## Assignment Reflection

What did you notice about the differences in runtime across algorithms as you changed the number of cards you were sorting? If you had to split them into "slower" algorithms vs "faster" algorithms, which would you put in each category?
Results:

I noticed that Merge Sort takes (much) less time in general, with selection sort and insertion sort taking roughly the same time. This might agree with:
I would put Merge Sort into faster algorithm category and Selection Sort and Insertion Sort into slower algorithm category.

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
